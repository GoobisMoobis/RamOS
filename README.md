RamOS is a HTML web-based operating system with games, movies, proxies & more.

## Announcements
Back in school August 26. Updates will release soon after, stay patient!
## KNOWN ISSUES (1.0.4)
**_DO NOT_** report these as issues.
- Incognito takes a long time to load, there is nothing we can do as we do not own their servers. Please be patient.
- The same goes with Astroid.
- Some websites on all proxies do not work, as they encrypt their data. We cannot do anything about this.
- Pop-Up leads to raw code. We are fixing this.
